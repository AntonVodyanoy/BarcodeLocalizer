The resulting cropped and localized images can then be decoded by other barcode decoders such as ZXing. \r\n\r\nMost barcode decoders, such as ZXing, cannot easily handle noisy images or images where the barcode is rotated, so using this package as a localizer prior to decoding significantly improves decode success rates.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
